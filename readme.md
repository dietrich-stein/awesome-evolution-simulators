<br/>
Evolution simulators models the principles of natural selection, mutation, genetic inheritance, and fitness evaluation to apply the process of evolution to populations of simulated lifeforms. They provide virtual environments designed for virtual organisms to compete for resources, reproduce, and evolve over time as their population adapt to pressures. Some of the awesome things that evolution simulators often incorporate as features include:<br /><br />

- Neural networks
- Cellular automata
- Reinforcement learning
- Particle physics
- Newtonian physics
- Procedural generation
- Pheremone trails
