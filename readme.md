<br/>
Evolution simulators are software that simulates the process of evolution and typically models the principles of natural selection, mutation, genetic inheritance, and fitness evaluation. They often use populations of virtual organisms or agents that can reproduce, pass on genetic traits, compete for resources in a simulated environment and evolve over time.<br /><br />

This list focuses on simulators that are truly awesome. We aim to find and list the ones that use advanced techniques to accelerate, enhance, or even replace the processes of evolution. Some technologies to look for include:<br /><br />

- Neural networks
- Cellular automata
- Reinforcement learning
- Particle physics
- Newtonian physics
- Procedural generation
